# Defect-Detection-Using-Enhanced-YOLO-Network


In this project I will use an object detector called YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect defects on metal surfaces such as scratches and patches.
YOLO is pre-trained to detect everyday objects such as cars, person, table etc... The challenge here is to re-train this network to detect
a custom dataset provided which contains images and labels of several defects.
